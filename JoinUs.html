            I definitely welcome many talented students to pursue the postgraduate degrees in our team or other research collaboration.
            But I would like to share some preferred requirements to potential students in the following, so that you understand our team culture
            and we make a bilaterally matched choice. It will be very useful to read the following contents before you consider to join us. <br>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        [Topic Fitting] This is the most important point. Due to the limited time, I only want to dive into a few
                        topics fundamentally. If we have the common research interest, it is very good. Otherwise, I do not suggest
                        you to choose our team.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [Research Goal] You should be taste- and aim- high. As you are being senior, I will limit your research
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [Research Ethic].
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [Research Effort].
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [Team Contribution].
                        </p>
