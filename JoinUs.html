            I definitely welcome promising students to pursue the postgraduate degrees in our team or other research collaboration.
            But I would like to share some preferred requirements to potential students in the following, so that you understand our team culture
            and we make a bilaterally matched choice. It will be very useful to read the following points before you consider to join us.
            [<font color="red">1 PhD</font>, <font color="red"><s>1 Master</s></font> in 2025's recruitment, and <font color="red">Infinite RAs</font>] <br>

            <div>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        [<b>Research Fitting</b>] This is the most important point. Due to the limited time, I only want to dive into a few
                        topics fundamentally. If we have the common research interest, it is very welcome. Otherwise, I do not suggest
                        you to choose our team, as the research in the team will be forced to fall in the planed topics.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [<b>Research Goal</b>] You should be progressively taste- and aim- high. As you are being senior, I will prevent your research from
                        low-hand fruits, no matter how promising revenues it means by taking a small step. I encourage
                        you to overcome the really challenging technical problems in your area, instead of being attracted by easy snacks. You will
                        receive my respect and support about graduation and job, when you succeed or even if you still fail finally after many trials.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [<b>Research Effort</b>] As we mainly focus on the technical challenges, it is always the case that the junior students suffer from the failure iteration
                        in most of the time. Therefore, more junior you are, more effort you should pay. If you always want to have sufficient weekends for fun when you have no any research paper, and you are not a talent, do not choose to join us. I definitely encourage students to make study and life balance,
                        but I mind a junior student who conducts an over-relaxed research due to the pursuit of the relaxed life. Making a good achievement in
                        a challenging topic is always hard and always sacrifices your spare time.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [<b>Research Ethic</b>] The students are forbidden to coauthor paper with other students in the name of a "last-week" discussion, or improving
                        writing. Currently, I am responsible to provide you guidance and improve your writing. If you want to get other students involved, it is better to
                        inform me very early and get my permission after my judgement. Treat your every research work as your child and be a responsible "parent" after it
                        is accepted: open your codes if possible, give some talks in public and let others understand your "children". Academic cheating is the
                        boundary line and any student making the thing in our team will be removed without any negotiation. Your graduation is not decided by
                        the paper count and be far away from academic cheating for a paper.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                        [<b>Team Contribution</b>] The diverse expenses of the team members, like the students' salary, the computing infrastructures, the
                        conference traveling fees and the journal publication fees, come from the PI's grants. It should be seriously treated when the
                        team requires you to contribute the effort in a reasonable sense. The student that only cares about himself/herself and escapes team contribution
                        on purpose will be gotten rid of the team.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
<!--                <br>-->
                Take the above points into deep consideration and make sure that you truly understand what they do imply.
